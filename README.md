## ðŸŽƒ My First Project: Dark & Spooky Theme

For my first project, I embraced the haunting allure of horror, Halloween, and the occult using pure **HTML** and **CSS**. 

I crafted a spine-chilling experience that features:
- ðŸŒ™ An introduction to the mystical **Walpurgis Night**
- ðŸŽ‰ Upcoming events tied to this enchanting celebration
- ðŸŽ¥ A curated list of soon-to-be-released **horror films**
- ðŸ›’ A simulated shop that lets visitors dive deeper into the eerie vibe
